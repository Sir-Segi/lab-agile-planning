**As a** Product development manager  
 **I need** the e-commerce platforms to be able to track and report product shelflife
 **So that** [benefit]  
   
 ### Details and Assumptions
 *the products on the e-commerce are from the 3 depots in Lagos alone
in lekki, agege and magodo
each depot has a depot manager who receives and records all product shelf-life
   
 ### Acceptance Criteria  
   
 ```gherkin
 Given that all depot heads can access the backend and update product shelflife in real time, I should be able to receive weekly product shelflife reports from the app, I should be able to get emergency emails if a product nears its expiry
 When ever I need it
 Then a report should be in my email
 ```
